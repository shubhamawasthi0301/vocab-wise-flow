## Project Description

This is an intelligent flashcard web application designed to help you expand your English vocabulary. The app utilizes a spaced repetition system to optimize learning and retention. Key features include:

- **Spaced Repetition:** Words you find difficult appear more frequently, while words you know well are shown less often, making your study sessions more efficient.
- **Multiple-Choice Quizzes:** To reinforce your knowledge, the app generates multiple-choice questions where you have to pick the correct definition for a word. This active recall method helps solidify your understanding.
